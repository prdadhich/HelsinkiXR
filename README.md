Some of the features I would implement 
1. Increasing the level of difficulty of the game everytime a ceratin amount of stars are collected. As we are already have count of stars collected, I will create two more variables, one to set the threshold for number of stars collected and the other for condition check to trigger an event whenever % of threshold variable changes.
2. Ability to pause and resume the game, can be easily implemeted by switching Time.timeScale value between 0&1 on key press event
